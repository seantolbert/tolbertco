          I am a full stack engineer with an inclination towards front end and
          mobile development with React and React Native.

          My previous career as a software sales representative at Zoom Video
          exposed me to the benefits of working in tech, and the potential of
          acting on powerful ideas quickly and strategically.
        </p>
        <p>
          I decided to become a web developer while leveraging my 5 years of
          Saas sales experience, making me a more dynamic addition to your
          developer team. Especially when communicating with other aspects of
          the business.
        </p>
        <p>
          My goal is to serve as a technical liason and create a communication
          hub within an organization to not only make internal handoffs more
          fluid, but to grow as both a developer and a leader.
